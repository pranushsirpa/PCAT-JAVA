BMI Calculator:
Create a BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator program.
The program should ask the user for their weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters). 
Then, calculate the BMI using the formula BMI = weight / (height * height). 
Finally, classify the BMI into categories according to the following criteria:
Underweight: BMI < 18.5
Normal weight: 18.5 <= BMI < 25
Overweight: 25 <= BMI < 30
Obese: BMI >= 30

Start
bmi=weight/(height*height)
enter height
enter weight
if(bmi<18.5)
print"underweight"
else if(bmi>=18.5 && bmi<25)
print "normal weight"
else if(bmi>=25 && bmi<30)
print "overweight"
else if(bmi>=30)
print"obese"
end
